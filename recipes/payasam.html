<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1/2 cup vermicelli (seviyan) or 1/4 cup rice (or any other grain like broken wheat)</li>
    <li>1 liter (4 cups) whole milk</li>
    <li>1/2 cup sugar (adjust to taste)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter)</li>
    <li>8-10 cashew nuts</li>
    <li>8-10 raisins</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon cardamom powder</li>
    <li>1  pinch saffron strands (optional, soaked in 1 tablespoon warm milk)</li>
    <li>2-3 tablespoons condensed milk (optional for extra creaminess)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of ghee in a pan.</li>
    <li>Add the vermicelli and roast on medium heat until it turns golden brown.</li>
    <li>Remove and set aside.</li>
    <li>In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, bring the milk to a boil.</li>
    <li>Reduce the heat to low and let the milk simmer, stirring occasionally to prevent it from sticking to the bottom.</li>
    <li>Add the roasted vermicelli to the boiling milk and cook until it becomes soft and the milk thickens slightly.</li>
    <li>Cook on low heat, stirring frequently, until the rice is fully cooked and the milk has thickened. This may take about 20-25 minutes.</li>
    <li>Payasam can be served warm or chilled, depending on your preference.</li>
</ol>
